# unit-4-game

Project Description

An interactive web browsers game that dynamically updates the HTML with the jQuery library.

How It Works

There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player’s total score.
The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
When the player clicks a crystal, the app updates the player’s score counter.
The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values.
The app will show the number of games the player wins and loses.
